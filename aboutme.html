    <h4> Jealousy by OSHO</h4>
    <p>
        This Book mainly talks about the psychological ignorance about yourself and things what happening in your real life realted stuff with or without 
        intension.<br> It makes to understand the people real love and relationship goals, how to give self respect to other person with out hurting them.<br>
        Mainly talks about marriage system and relationship compare to oldend days and present days.<br>If you like something good in anyone or self you should say it 
        without hestitating and receiving the things vice versa.<br> I like this book because its very close to me and family. one of the favorite book i red it 2 days without skipping.
